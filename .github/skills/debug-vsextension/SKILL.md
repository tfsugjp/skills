# Visual Studio Options Registration Debugging

This skill is a reusable playbook for diagnosing why a Visual Studio extension's **Tools > Options** category/page does not appear or cannot load.  
It is designed for **any extension architecture** (VSSDK in-proc, VisualStudio.Extensibility out-of-proc, or hybrid VSIX).

Primary workflow:
1. Identify the exact Visual Studio instance being inspected.
2. Collect a deterministic ActivityLog (`/log`).
3. Validate VSIX and pkgdef/package registration artifacts.
4. Separate "category invisible" failures from "page load failed" failures.
5. Only then modify packaging or registration.

Use these sample scripts first (they are examples and can be adapted to your extension/repo):
- [get-active-visual-studio-instance.ps1](sample_codes/get-active-visual-studio-instance.ps1)
- [start-exp-with-log.ps1](sample_codes/start-exp-with-log.ps1)
- [inspect-vsix-contents.ps1](sample_codes/inspect-vsix-contents.ps1)

## Key Concepts

### 1) Instance accuracy comes first

Do not assume the visible Visual Studio window is `/RootSuffix Exp`.  
Always inspect the active `devenv.exe` command line before checking registry/profile folders.

### 2) `/log` must be explicit when logs are missing

Activity logs are only written for sessions launched with `/log`.  
If no log file exists, relaunch with an explicit output path and use that session as your evidence source.

### 3) Manifest/image discovery and pkgdef discovery are different pipelines

An extension can be visible to one discovery path (for example image/manifest scanning) and still be absent from pkgdef merge/registration.  
Always verify both:
- where VS searches manifests/images
- where VS searches pkgdefs/packages

### 4) Prefer one authoritative install path

When debugging Options registration, avoid mixing install paths (for example "main VSIX + separate hand-placed sidecar") unless you can prove both are supported for your VS version.  
If one path is unsupported or ignored, keep registration on the path Visual Studio actually installs and merges.

### 5) Generated pkgdef is usually authoritative

For VSSDK package registration, prefer VSSDK-generated pkgdef output over static handwritten pkgdef files.  
Static copies often drift and can hide build/runtime mismatches.

### 6) Distinguish two failure classes

- **Options category does not appear** → usually registration/discovery/VSIX payload problem.
- **Category appears but page fails to load** → usually package activation/dependency/load-context problem.

Treat these as separate branches with separate evidence.

## Common Patterns

### Pattern 1: Identify the active Visual Studio target

```powershell
Get-CimInstance Win32_Process -Filter "name = 'devenv.exe'" |
    Select-Object ProcessId, ExecutablePath, CommandLine
```

### Pattern 2: Start Visual Studio with deterministic `/log`

```powershell
$logPath = Join-Path $env:APPDATA 'Microsoft\VisualStudio\ExtensionDebug-ActivityLog.xml'
$devenv = 'C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio\2022\Enterprise\Common7\IDE\devenv.exe'
Start-Process -FilePath $devenv -ArgumentList '/RootSuffix', 'Exp', '/Log', $logPath
```

### Pattern 3: Inspect produced VSIX payload

```powershell
$vsix = Get-ChildItem '.\src' -Filter *.vsix -Recurse |
    Sort-Object LastWriteTime -Descending |
    Select-Object -First 1

Add-Type -AssemblyName System.IO.Compression.FileSystem
$zip = [System.IO.Compression.ZipFile]::OpenRead($vsix.FullName)
try {
    $zip.Entries |
        Where-Object { $_.FullName -match 'extension\.vsixmanifest|pkgdef|Package\.dll' } |
        Select-Object -ExpandProperty FullName
}
finally {
    $zip.Dispose()
}
```

### Pattern 4: Check for page-load signatures in ActivityLog

```powershell
$logPath = Join-Path $env:APPDATA 'Microsoft\VisualStudio\ExtensionDebug-ActivityLog.xml'
Select-String -Path $logPath -Pattern 'No InprocServer32 registered for package|CreateInstance failed|FileNotFoundException' -Context 2,4
```

## Investigation Checklist

1. **Active instance**
   - Confirm command line and root suffix.
   - Confirm exact VS SKU/version/channel.
2. **Log availability**
   - Use explicit `/log` and retain that file as evidence.
3. **Profile alignment**
   - Match local/roaming paths to the exact instance under test.
4. **Build artifact validation**
   - Check generated manifest and final VSIX payload.
   - Check pkgdef generation output from build artifacts.
5. **Runtime diagnostics**
   - Review ActivityLog for package registration/load failures.
   - If category appears but page load fails, prioritize package activation diagnostics.
6. **Registration strategy validation**
   - Confirm your chosen install path is actually supported by current VS behavior.
   - Avoid mixing unsupported "manual copy" paths with installer-managed paths.

## Guardrails

- Do not assume behavior from an older Visual Studio version applies to current preview/insiders builds.
- Do not use `VsRegEdit.exe` as a substitute for full pkgdef install flow unless you explicitly need registry diagnostics.
- Do not accept a one-SKU-only fix if your extension targets Community/Pro/Enterprise.
- Do not merge changes without validating both:
  1. Options node visibility
  2. property page load behavior

## How to Adapt This Skill to a Specific Extension

Replace these placeholders in your investigation notes:
- Extension/package IDs and GUIDs
- Expected VSIX entries (dll/pkgdef/asset paths)
- Known-good baseline commit/PR
- Known error signatures for your package
- Required supported VS SKUs/architectures

You can then keep this same workflow and checklist unchanged.
